Syllabus, topics covered in "Introduction to machine learning and
neural networks" by Toby Dylan Hocking, July 2020.

Definition, purpose, and advantages of supervised learning.

Applications of supervised learning to text/image data, classification
and regression.

K-Fold Cross-Validation for data splitting, and the purpose of
train/test/subtrain/validation sets during machine learning model
training and evaluation.

How to detect and avoid overfitting.

Storage of machine learning data sets in CSV files, and how to read
them into R and convert them into data structures that can be used
with R functions that implement machine learning algorithms.

Training neural networks using R packages nnet and keras.

Comparing prediction accuracy of learned models using test sets and
K-fold cross-validation.
