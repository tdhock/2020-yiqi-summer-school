Quiz questions for each lecture:

- Lecture 1: Introduction to machine learning and selected applications, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Lb-a5GT4vQ&list=PLwc48KSH3D1NBixIvVYPXJ1GPtA9RAA8K&index=2&t=0s
  - a supervised learning algorithm will input a labeled
    training data set, and output what?
    ANSWER: a function for predicting labels/outputs given features/inputs.
  - what are three advantages of supervised machine
    learning, relative to classical programming techniques?
    ANSWER: 1. state-of-the-art accuracy with enough data
    2. programmer does not need domain knowledge
    3. pattern encoded in data/labels
- Lecture 2: Demonstrating overfitting in regression, introduction to R programming, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DoeROToJ8U&list=PLwc48KSH3D1NBixIvVYPXJ1GPtA9RAA8K&index=3&t=0s
  - when splitting data into train/test sets, what is the purpose of the train set?
    ANSWER: used to find/optimize model parameters to
    maximize prediction accuracy / minimize loss/error.
  - when splitting data into train/test sets, what is the purpose of the test set?
    ANSWER: used to evaluate prediction accuracy of learned models.
  - when splitting a train set into subtrain/validation
    sets, what is the purpose of the subtrain set?
    ANSWER: used in learning algorithm such as gradient descent,
    which directly minimizes the subtrain set loss/error.
  - when splitting a train set into subtrain/validation
    sets, what is the purpose of the validation set?
    ANSWER: used to learn hyper-parameters to avoid overfitting.
  - The goal of supervised machine learning is to get a function that
    yields highly accurate predictions with respect to what data?
    ANSWER: new/unseen/test data.
  - How can you tell if machine learning model predictions are
    overfitting?
    ANSWER: accuracy is high on train/subtrain set but low on test/validation set.
  - In 4-fold cross-validation, we randomly assign each observation a fold ID
    in what range of values?
    ANSWER: from 1 to 4, {1, 2, 3, 4}.
  - In 4-fold cross-validation for subtrain/validation splits, if the
    validation fold ID is 3, then what observations are used as the
    subtrain set?
    ANSWER: all observations which were assigned another fold ID (1,2,4).
  - Machine learning data sets are usually stored in CSV data files,
    where rows are OBSERVATIONS and columns are INPUTS/FEATURES and OUTPUT/LABEL.
  - When using the nnet::nnet function in R to learn a neural network
    with a single hidden layer, what data set
    (all/train/test/subtrain/validation) should you pass as the second
    argument?
    ANSWER: subtrain.
  - When using the nnet::nnet function in R to learn a neural network
    with a single hidden layer, do LARGE or SMALL values of the maxit
    hyper-parameter result in overfitting?
    ANSWER: LARGE.
  - When using the nnet::nnet function in R to learn a neural network
    with a single hidden layer, do LARGE or SMALL values of the size
    hyper-parameter result in overfitting?
    ANSWER: LARGE.
- Lecture 3: Intro to neural networks for image classification using R/keras, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0DBo7RNBlI&list=PLwc48KSH3D1NBixIvVYPXJ1GPtA9RAA8K&index=4&t=0s
  - In multi-class classification problems with keras in R, the
    output/label data must be stored in what data structure?
    ANSWER: binary matrix (one-hot encoding, rows=observations, columns=classes).
  - To use image data as inputs, you need to use what data structure?
    ANSWER: 4-dimensional array (observations, pixels high, pixels wide, channels).
  - When using the keras::fit function, what data set
    (all/train/test/subtrain/validation) should you pass as the first
    two arguments?
    ANSWER: train.
  - Using keras::fit with validation_split=0.3 implies what percents
    of data allocated to subtrain and validation sets?
    ANSWER: 70% subtrain, 30% validation.
  - When using 4-fold cross-validation for model evaluation, the test
    set is used for what?
    ANSWER: it is only used after having fully trained models
    (including hyper-parameters), in order to evaluate prediction accuracy.
  - To determine if classification models have learned any non-trivial
    patterns in the data, they should be compared with a baseline
    which ignores all inputs/features and always predicts what value?
    ANSWER: the most frequent label in the train set.
